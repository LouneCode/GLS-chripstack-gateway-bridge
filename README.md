# GLS ChirpStack Gateway Bridge - with the Fine timestamp support (for TDOA geolocation)

This project implements a Fine Timestamp property to [ChirpStack Gateway Bridge](https://github.com/chirpstack/chirpstack-gateway-bridge). GLS ChirpStack Gateway Bridge is a Docker image and it  runs on a PC, Raspberry Pi 4 and Compute module4. 

The module should installed with the [GLS Basic Station Docker image](https://github.com/LouneCode/gls-basicstation) to get Fine Timestamp property working on Chirpstack LNS.

The Fine Timestamp solution works with following LoRa concentators which can use GPS PPS signal:  SX1302, SX1303 LoRa concentrators modules (RAK2287, RAK5146, RAK831, WM1302 concentrator modules or RAK7248, RAK7248C, RAK7271, RAK7371 WisGate Development gateways).

GLS ChirpStack Gateway Bridge is fully function version of the original [ChirpStack Gateway Bridge](https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/community/source/) and it enables the fineTimeSinceGpsEpoch field in uplink event JSON messages with a nanosecond precision as follows:

&nbsp;

## 1) Compile GLS ChirpStack Gateway Bridge Docker image 

``` sourceCode

$ git clone https://github.com/LouneCode/GLS-chripstack-gateway-bridge.git GLS-chripstack-gateway-bridge 
$ cd GLS-chripstack-gateway-bridge
$ sudo docker build --build-arg REMOTE_TAG=v4.0.5 . -t gls-chirpstack-gateway-bridge:4.0.5.1
$ docker images

```

&nbsp;

## 2) CompileGLS Basic Station Docker image 

&nbsp;

See [GLS Basic Station](https://github.com/LouneCode/gls-basicstation) Docker image compilation instuctions.
